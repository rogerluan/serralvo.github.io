One month ago I was in the 18th edition of Semana Integrada (an event promoted by PUC Campinas - more info here), in this event I had the opportunity to talk about Git, it was an awesome ðŸ™Œ experience and here I'll tell why.

### The Event

Semana Integrada is an event in PUC Campinas that offers activities to CEATECs (Centre for Exact Sciences, Technology, and the Environment) students. Are offered activities like mini-courses, lectures, and workshops.

### Mini-course's Objective

Version control, in general, is an important tool in software development process, nowaday every company in the world use some version control software. The mini-course objective was to introduce basic version control concepts and practice it in an activity using Github's platform.

### Material

You can get the Keynote here.

### Conclusion

In two hours I had the opportunity to share my knowledge with twenty students, but, isn't just that, this number will change, why am I thinking it? The answer: in 2013 I signed up in an activity like this and three years late I went to the same build to talk about the same subject, Git. 

// TO-DO: Finish the conclusion.
